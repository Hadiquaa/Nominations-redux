# React Redux Nominations Project

Welcome to the **React Redux Nominations Project**! This is a simple app I built while diving into the world of React and Redux. It's all about adding, managing, and removing movie nominations (with a twist!).

## What's the Deal?
- **Nominate Your Faves:** Add movies to your nomination list with just a click. 
- **Five's the Limit:** You can only nominate up to 5 movies. 
- **Easy Peasy Removal:** Changed your mind? Remove a movie just as easily.
- **Toast it Up:** Get instant feedback with snazzy toast notifications when you add or remove a movie.

## How It Works
### Adding Movies
Click the "Add" button to nominate a movie. If it's already in the list, it won't get added again. 

### Keeping It to 5
To keep things fair and exciting, you can only nominate a maximum of 5 movies. 

### Removing Movies
Click the "Remove" button, and it's gone.

## What's Under the Hood
This project uses:
- **React** for the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit** to manage all the state like a pro.
- **React-Redux** to tie everything together.
- **React-Hot-Toast** for those delightful notifications.
- **React Icons** to make the UI pop a little more.
- **OMDB API** to fetch movie data dynamically.

## How to Get Started
1. Clone the project:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Jump into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd redux-nominations
   ```
3. Install the goodies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Fire it up:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and start nominating!

## Why This Project?
I wanted to explore Redux and learn how it can make managing state easier (and less stressful). This project was the perfect playground for understanding slices, reducers, and dispatching actions.

## What Could Be Next?
- **Search Movies:** Add a search bar to find movies more easily.
- **API Integration:** Fetch movies dynamically from a database like OMDB.
- **Cooler UI:** Make it all fancy with animations and better styling.
- **Save Progress:** Use tools like Redux Persist to keep nominations saved between reloads.

## Thanks for Stopping By!
This was a fun little journey into React and Redux. If youâ€™re learning too, I hope this inspires you to create your own projects and experiment. Now go ahead and nominate some movies!

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ¥âœ¨
